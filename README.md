  - Data/dataModel.sql

Live Usage
-----------

	$paymentParams['AMOUNT'] = $amount;
	$paymentParams['CURRENCY'] = $currency;

	$paymentParams['CARDHOLDERNAME'] = $cardHolderName;
	//month two digits (09 for september)
	$paymentParams['MONTH'] = $cardMonth;
	//year two digits (16 for 2016)
	$paymentParams['YEAR'] = $cardYear;
	//CVV 3 or 4 Digits depending on vendor

	//'live' for live environment
	//'test' for test environment
  	$pivotal = new Pivotal('live',$paymentParams);

  	//configure your db to autosave transactions
	$pivotal->_dbConfig = array('server' => 'localhost', 'login' => 'root', 'password' => 'root', 'database' => 'myDb');

	//transactions won't be saved in the DB
  	$response = $pivotal->sendPayment();

		'UNIQUEREF' => 'GW5CWTXWIW',
		'RESPONSECODE' => 'A',
		'RESPONSETEXT' => 'APPROVAL',
		'APPROVALCODE' => '475318',
		'DATETIME' => '2014-11-10T17:25:58',

  	//$DIR see section installation below
  	require_once($DIR.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'Helper'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'form.php');

	//$action = formAction see http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_action.asp for more info

	$pivotal_form = new Pivotal_Form($action);
  	echo $pivotal_form->buildForm();

Extra
-----------
This Lib also provide Regex to detect card vendor (REGEX are located in Data/CardTypes.json)
and you can read the vendor based on the Card Number


	//$DIR see section installation below
  	require_once($DIR.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'Pivotal.php');

	$pivotal_config = new Pivotal_Config('test');

	//this clean and compare the card number to regular expression config located under Data/CardTypes.json
	//please feel free to add new credit card type but keep in mind the the order in the CardTypes.json is important and that last pattern found = output
	//so be sure to have VISA, MASTERCARD before resellers (VISA DEBIT is part of VISA for instance which means that VISA should be before VISA DEBIT)

	$vendor = $pivotal_config->getCardType('1234567890123456');
